    A request acts on one or more Ceph-managed objects, i.e.
    mon, mds, osd, pg.

    Amist the terminology mess of 'jobs', 'commands', 'operations', this class
    is named for clarity: it's an operation at an end-user level of
    granularity, something that might be a button in the UI.

    UserRequests are usually remotely executed on a mon.  However, there
    may be a final step of updating the state of ClusterMonitor in order
    that subsequent REST API consumer reads return values consistent with
    the job having completed, e.g. waiting for the OSD map to be up
    to date before calling a pool creation complete.  For this reason,
    UserRequests have a local ID and completion state that is independent
    of their remote ID (salt jid).  UserRequests may also execute more than
    one JID in the course of their lifetime.

    Requests have the following lifecycle:
     NEW object is created, it has all the information needed to do its job
         other than where it should execute.
     SUBMITTED the request has started executing, usually this will have involved sending
               out a salt job, so .jid is often set but not always.
     COMPLETE no further action, this instance will remain constant from this point on.
              this does not indicate anything about success or failure.
